# Stage FX shaders
Shaders that I use in [DJL Dance Stage world](https://www.vrchat.net/home/launch?worldId=wrld_a7f7d997-5261-4f64-abd2-082757d9797c)  
Processing shader is used with render textures to simulate custom render loop.  
Processing shader version shared here is trimmed to exclude noise-based features (namely _Fire_ mode and _Sparkle_ modifier found in the VRC world)  
  
**Prefabs with unity package will be uploaded later**
